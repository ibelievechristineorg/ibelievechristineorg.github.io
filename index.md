If you believe Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, it's time to speak up.

Everyone is welcome to participate.
In particular, though, if you're a man, we're asking you to step up now.

We believe men should support women when they come forward to report abuse.
It's not right for the most visible men to be a small group attacking her,
and it's not right for women to have to stand alone.  Let's change that.

[Here's how to participate.](howto.html)

Regardless of whether Dr. Blasey chooses to testify on Monday,
we want to make sure that voices of support come through for her,
especially before the scheduled committee hearing.
